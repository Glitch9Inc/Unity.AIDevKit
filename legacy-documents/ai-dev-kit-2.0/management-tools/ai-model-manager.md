**Model Manager** is designed to streamline the management and selection of OpenAI models within your Unity projects. It provides a centralized interface for viewing detailed information about each model, including types, capabilities, pricing, and usage statistics. This guide outlines how to effectively use the Model Manager to enhance your project's integration with OpenAI services.

### Accessing the Model Manager

Open the Model Manager by selecting `Tools > Glitch9 > OpenAI > Model Manager` from the Unity Editor's top menu. This action will open the Model Manager window, displaying a comprehensive list of OpenAI models available for use in your project.

### Key Features

* **Comprehensive Model Overview**: View detailed information about each OpenAI model, including model names, types, creation dates, and maximum tokens.
* **Filtering Options**: Utilize filters to narrow down the list of models based on type or other criteria, making it easier to find the models that suit your project's needs.
* **Usage and Pricing Information**: Access important details on model usage limits and pricing to manage your project's budget and OpenAI API usage effectively.
* **Direct Model Selection**: Easily select and manage models directly within the Unity Editor, streamlining the workflow for integrating OpenAI services into your project.

### Using the Model Manager

#### Viewing Model Information

1. **Model List**: The main window displays a list of all available models, organized in a tree view for easy navigation. Each entry provides key information about the model, such as type and creation date.
2. **Model Details**: Selecting a model from the list will show detailed information about that model, including usage statistics and pricing information, in the detail panel.

#### Filtering Models

* **Type Filter**: Use the dropdown menus at the top of the Model Manager window to filter models by type (e.g., GPT, DALLÂ·E, Codex). This allows you to quickly find models relevant to your project's specific needs.
* **Search Functionality**: Employ the search bar to filter the model list based on model names or other keywords, enabling you to rapidly locate specific models.

#### Managing Models

* **Selecting Models**: Once you have found a model that suits your project's requirements, you can easily select it for use within your Unity project by noting its model ID or name.
* **Refreshing Model List**: If you've added new models to your OpenAI account or wish to update the model list, use the "Reload Model Metadata" or "Update Models from API" buttons to refresh the list with the latest data from OpenAI.

#### Best Practices

* **Stay Informed on Model Updates**: Regularly check the Model Manager for updates or new models released by OpenAI that could enhance your project.
* **Monitor Model Usage**: Keep an eye on the usage and pricing information for selected models to ensure your project remains within budget and complies with any usage restrictions.
* **Experiment with Different Models**: Don't hesitate to experiment with different models to find the ones that best meet the needs of your project, considering factors like performance, cost, and output quality.
