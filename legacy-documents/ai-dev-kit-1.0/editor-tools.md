These Editor Tools are accessible under the `Tools > Glitch9 > OpenAI` menu path in the Unity Editor. This convenient location ensures easy access to all the integrated functionalities.

### Editor Tools at a Glance

The suite includes:

* **EditorGPT**: Leverage GPT models for generating dynamic text. It's perfect for scripting dialogues, creating narratives, and assisting in content creation.
* **EditorDALLÂ·E**: Transform textual descriptions into images right within the editor environment, utilizing the DALL-E model's capability to bring text descriptions to visual life.
* **EditorTTS**: Convert text into lifelike speech, enhancing games and apps with high-quality voiceovers and interactive dialogue capabilities.

Features and Functionalities:

* **Custom Settings**: Each tool comes with adjustable settings to cater to unique project needs.
* **Interactive Interface**: A straightforward GUI is integrated into the Unity Editor, streamlining the data input and output review process.
* **Workflow Integration**: Designed to complement Unity's workflow, ensuring a non-disruptive development process.
* **Model Selection**: Users can select from various AI models, like GPT-3 and GPT-4, to find the most suitable option for their tasks.
* **Session Management**: Control AI interactions within the editor, with full access to session histories and outcomes.
* **Resource Efficiency**: The tools are optimized for minimal system resource usage, maintaining editor performance.

### Management Tools Suite

The Management Tools suite comprises several key components, each tailored to a specific aspect of OpenAI service management:

* **Model Manager**: This tool offers a comprehensive overview of all OpenAI models available within your project, including details on model types, creation dates, usage tokens, and pricing information. It allows developers to easily manage and select the most appropriate models for their needs.
* **Log Manager**: A powerful feature for tracking and reviewing all interactions with OpenAI services. The Log Manager records details of every request and response, including input, output, associated model, and incurred costs. It supports filtering and searching to help developers quickly find specific logs.

Key Features and Functionalities:

* **Comprehensive Data Presentation**: Management Tools present detailed information on OpenAI models and service usage, ensuring developers have all the data they need to make informed decisions.
* **Filtering and Search**: Quickly locate specific models or logs with flexible filtering options and a powerful search feature.
* **Usage and Cost Tracking**: Keep a close eye on how OpenAI services are used within your project and monitor associated costs to manage your budget effectively.
* **Direct Integration within Unity**: Access these management capabilities directly within the Unity Editor, streamlining your workflow and eliminating the need to switch between different tools or platforms.
