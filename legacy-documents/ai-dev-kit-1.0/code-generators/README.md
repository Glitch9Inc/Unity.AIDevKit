**AI Development Kit** introduces two powerful code generators designed to enhance productivity and creativity within the Unity environment: the C# Script Generator and the Unity Component Generator. These tools leverage advanced AI models to automate the generation of C# scripts and Unity components based on natural language prompts provided by the developer.

### C# Script Generator

The C# Script Generator is tailored for developers looking to quickly create C# scripts for Unity. By inputting descriptive prompts about the desired script's functionality, developers can receive ready-to-use C# code snippets. This tool is ideal for generating scripts for common tasks, complex algorithms, or even game mechanics that would otherwise require significant time and effort to code manually.

#### Key Features:

* **Prompt-based Script Generation**: Generates C# scripts based on natural language descriptions.
* **Customizable Output**: Allows for the specification of namespaces and adherence to project coding standards.
* **Integration with Unity Editor**: Directly accessible within the Unity Editor for a seamless workflow.

### Unity Component Generator

The Unity Component Generator focuses on creating MonoBehaviour scripts that can be attached as components to GameObjects in Unity. This tool simplifies the process of adding new behaviors to GameObjects, from player controls and AI behaviors to game management systems, by generating the code necessary based on the developer's descriptions.

#### Key Features:

* **Component-specific Script Generation**: Produces scripts intended to be used as components within Unity.
* **Automatic Script Attachment**: Once generated, scripts can be automatically attached to selected GameObjects in the scene.
* **Prompt-based Customization**: Developers can specify the exact behavior and functionality they need through natural language prompts.
