<summary>My OpenAI free trial has ended or is inactive</summary>

There are lots of other ways to continue using AI Dev Kit. For free, if you want.

* **Upgrade to a paid OpenAI API account** – This is the most straightforward and affordable option. Most users spend less than $1 per month when actively using AI Dev Kit.

- **Try free alternatives like Google Gemini or OpenRouter** – Both Google and OpenRouter offers access to several free models that work seamlessly with AI Dev Kit. It's a great option if you're looking to continue development without spending anything.
- **If you're looking for a local, cost-free option, AI Dev Kit also supports Ollama as an AI backend.** Ollama runs models directly on your device (or your own server), eliminating the need for API keys or internet access.

* **Create a new OpenAI account** – If you have access to an additional phone number, you may create a new OpenAI account to receive a new free trial API key.

<summary>I have ChatGPT Plus subscription. Why can't I use OpenAI's paid models?</summary>

**Subscribing to ChatGPT Plus doesn't give you API access — it's only for using ChatGPT on the web.**\
If you're planning to use ChatGPT inside Unity or any other app, you'll need to set up **API billing** by enabling the "Pay-as-you-go" option in your OpenAI account.

<summary>I'm a student. Do you give out vouchers?</summary>

I appreciate your interest in **AI Dev Kit**! However, I currently give out vouchers **only to YouTubers, streamers, or influencers** who can help promote the asset publicly.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is because each voucher is limited and meant for marketing purposes.\
If you have an audience and would like to showcase the asset in a video or post, feel free to reach out and share your content!

<summary>I'm broke. What are the free API options?</summary>

No worries — you can still use **AI Dev Kit** without spending a dime. Here are several zero-cost options that work seamlessly:

* **Run models locally with Ollama**\
  Ollama lets you run powerful open-source models like LLaMA 3 directly on your machine, with **no API key or internet required**. It’s fully supported as a local backend in AI Dev Kit.\
  [Start settings up Ollama here. ](../quick-start/self-hosting-with-ollama.md)

- **Use Google Gemini's free tier**\
  Google Cloud offers a monthly free quota for Gemini models.\
  Simply sign up for a Google Cloud account, generate an API key, and you’re good to go.\
  [Get Google's free API key here.](../platform-api/google-gemini/)
- **Try OpenRouter’s free models**\
  **OpenRouter** aggregates access to various models — some of which are free to use without authentication. You can easily distinguish which models are free using [AI Dev Kit Model Library.](broken-reference)\

<summary>Is this safe to use in a commercial game?</summary>

Yes — as long as you follow the licensing terms of each AI provider.\
Most major providers (OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs) allow their APIs to be used in commercial products, including games.

However, always check for:

* **Attribution requirements**

- **Content usage limits (e.g. for generated voices or images)**

* **Prohibited use cases (e.g. misinformation, impersonation)**

Refer to each provider’s Terms of Use to ensure full compliance.
