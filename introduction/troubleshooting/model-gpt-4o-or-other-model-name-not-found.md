# Model 'gpt-4o (or other model name)' not found

### **Issue**

{% hint style="danger" %}
When sending a request, you may encounter the error saying\
&#xNAN;**"Model '{model\_name}' not found."**
{% endhint %}

### **Possible Cause**

{% hint style="info" %}
Your account (your API key) may not have the permission to use the model with your current tier level. If you are wondering why because you have the ChatGPT subscription, please refer to '_<mark style="color:yellow;">I have ChatGPT Plus subscription. Why can't I use OpenAI's paid models?</mark>_' section in [FAQ](../faq.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **How to Fix**

{% hint style="success" %}
In the Project window, delete the entire `Assets/Glitch9` folder, then re-import **AI Dev Kit** from the Package **Add a Payment Plan**: To access the latest models, you need to add a payment plan and purchase credits. You can do this by visiting the [Billing Overview](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview) page.

**Make a Payment**: Ensure you make a successful payment (minimum $5). After the payment is processed, access to the latest models and higher rate limits should be enabled.
