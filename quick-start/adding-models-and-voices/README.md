# Adding Models & Voices

**AI Dev Kit supports over 450 AI models and more than 4,000 voices across multiple providers**, including OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, and more.

However, you **can’t use them all right away out of the box.**

**Why?**

Because loading thousands of options by default would:

* Overwhelm dropdown menus in the inspector
* Slow down the editor interface
* Flood code snippets and auto-complete with irrelevant entries
* Make your project harder to manage, not easier

Instead, AI Dev Kit follows a **"register-as-needed"** approach.

You choose and register only the models and voices you plan to use — keeping your project clean, performant, and tailored to your workflow via **Model Library** and **Voice Library**.
